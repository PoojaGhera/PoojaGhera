## Hi, I am Pooja 👋

I am currently an AI PM @ Meta Reality Labs working on Codec Avatars and was previosly at Amazon Alexa and AWS. This repository is my skunk work projects/experiments which I understake to learn or dive-deep into a particular area. Or just building for fun! 

More to come as I add more projects to this repo. 

List of projects and goals <br>
1/ [ai-trip-planner](https://github.com/PoojaGhera/playground/blob/main/ai-trip-planner/README.md) - This project is a web-based AI Trip Planner designed to explore and compare the capabilities of the three major AI providers. The goal was to build a unified interface that interacts with different LLMs while tracking performance metrics. This includes successfull connection to Open AI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic.
